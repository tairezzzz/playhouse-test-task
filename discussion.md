## Part 2
<p>Prioritized tasks' list:</p>
<ol>
<li>One of our testers reported a crash that recurs once every few days. Cursory investigation hasn't been able to reproduce the issue</li>
<li>There are some duplicate listings because we weren't able to match address data effectively</li>
<li>Full integration test coverage</li>
<li>Some of our API integrations have the credentials hard-coded into our private repository</li>
<li>Dockerize application for repeatable deployments</li>
<li>Users should be able to browse videos with intuitive swipe gestures</li>
<li>Users should be able to engage (like / dislike) with intuitive swipe gestures</li>
<li>Users should be able to set a different display name</li>
<li>On mobile everything looks screwy</li>
<li>I don't like having to hit play every time</li>
<li>Why doesn't it start with the places closest to me?</li>
<li>It keeps showing me videos that aren't my style at all</li>
<li>There's not enough to do here</li>
</ol>
<p>At first we should decide some problems with crash and matching address data. The next steps are tests coverage, security of credentials and dokerization.
We need to get more information about user's feedback and collect some details about what components look screwy on the mobile phones, etc.
