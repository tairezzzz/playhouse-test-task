# Readme

Welcome to our coding assessment! 

This code should be used as a baseline for question 1. We intentionally wrote the code to be as "vanilla JS" as possible in order to have a level playing field for all candidates.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start the server with `npm run dev`
3. Access the server in your browser from localhost:3000
4. As you make updates, nodemon will generally update the server with your updates but you will manually need to reload your browser window.

## Submission
Note that you don't need to send us any credentials, just provide clear instructions for how to run your application.

1. Populate `discussion.md` with responses to any discussion questions
2. Create a zip file with your code (it is not necessary to include `node_modules`)
3. Submit your zip file and your personal details [here](todo)
